    "In the midterm, you're going to use all of the programming and data management skills you've developed so far to build a risk calculator that pretends to be integrated with a clinical registry.  You'll compute the PRIEST COVID-19 Clinical Severity Score for a series of patients and, based on their risk of an adverse outcome, query a REST web service to find a hospital to transfer them to. The end result of your work will be a list of instructions on where each patient should be discharged: \"home\" if they are below 30% risk and the recommended hospital if they are at or above 30%.\n",

    "\n",
    "This scoring algorithm can be found [here on the MDCalc website](https://www.mdcalc.com/priest-covid-19-clinical-severity-score#evidence).  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will need to write a function called **priest()** with the following input parameters.  \n",
    " * Sex\n",
    " * Age in years\n",
    " * Respiratory rate in breaths per minute\n",
    " * Oxygen saturation as a percent between 0 and 1\n",
    " * Heart rate in beats per minute\n",
    " * Systolic BP in mmHg\n",
    " * Temperature in degrees C\n",
    " * Alertness as a string description\n",
    " * Inspired Oxygen as as string description\n",
    " * Performance Status as a string description\n",
    "2. The function will need to follow the algorithm provided on the MDCalc website to compute a risk percentage that should be returned as a numeric value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "3. Be sure to use docstring documentation and at least three built-in docstring test cases.\n",
    "4. Assume that the input values that are strings could be any combination of upper or lower case. For example: 'male', 'Male', 'MALE', 'MalE' should all be interpretted by your code as male.\n",
    "5. If any of the inputs are invalid (for example a sex value that is not recognizable as male or female) your code should raise a ValueException that includes a message with the invalid input and which parameter that input was provided as.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTES:\n",
    "1. In the final step there is a rule to convert form raw score to percentile.  In that conversion, 17-25 maps to 59-88% and â‰¥26 maps to >99%.  For our purposes, we want these to be specific % number outputs.  Use the following rule:\n",
    " * If score is between 17 and 25, percentile should be 0.59\n",
    " * If score is greater than or equal to 26, percentile should be 0.99\n"
